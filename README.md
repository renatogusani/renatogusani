## About

I work at the intersection of **security, systems, and venture building**.

By day, I’m a **Cybersecurity Analyst at IBM**, focused on detection engineering, analysis, and strengthening security posture at scale.  
Alongside this, I’m the **founder of VNTA**, a Dublin-based venture studio exploring culture, creation, and disciplined execution across multiple projects.

My work is grounded in clarity, restraint, and long-term thinking — building quietly, deliberately, and with purpose.
